# 🎉 Attendance+ 🎉

Attendance+ is a Flutter app designed for **attendance tracking in large lecture halls and classrooms**. 🏫📱

## 🚀 Main Idea

This app automates the attendance process, saving **teachers valuable time** ⏰ and solving the problem of monitoring students during lectures. 👩‍🏫👨‍🎓

## ⭐ Key Features

- ⏳ **2-minute countdown timer** for marking attendance  
- 📍 **Geolocation with a 30-meter radius** — students must be physically close to the lecture hall  
- ❌ If a student is outside the 30-meter radius **and** doesn’t mark attendance within 2 minutes, they are marked as **absent** 🚫  
- 🔥 Firebase integration for secure data storage and authentication  
- 🎮 Built-in **Tetris mini-game** to add some fun during breaks!  
- 📲 Cross-platform support for **Android & iOS**

## 🛠 Technologies

- Flutter & Dart  
- Firebase Authentication & Firestore  
- Geolocation API (GPS)  
- Native Android & iOS features

## 💡 About the App

Attendance+ solves the challenge of checking attendance in big lectures where manual checking is hard. The timer and geolocation make sure students are really there — no cheating! 😉 This helps teachers save time and keeps the process fair and transparent.
